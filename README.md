**Lunar Dust and Duct Tape**

### Description
Why is the Moon so dusty? On Earth, rocks are weathered by wind and water, creating soil and sand. On the Moon, eons of constant micrometeorite bombardment have blasted away at the rocky surface creating a layer of powdery lunar soil or regolith.  For the Apollo astronauts and their equipment, the pervasive, fine, gritty dust was definitely a problem. On the lunar surface in December 1972, Apollo 17 astronauts Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan needed to repair one of their rover's fenders in an effort to keep the rooster tails of dust away from themselves and their gear. This picture reveals the wheel and fender of their dust covered rover along with the ingenious application of spare maps, clamps, and a grey strip of "duct tape".

## What it does
- Runs automatically every day at 12:00 UTC
- Updates a log file with the current date and system information
- Fetches NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day
- **Updates this README with space imagery and descriptions**
- Commits and pushes these changes automatically

## Why I built this
This project showcases:
- GitHub Actions and CI/CD workflows
- Automation scripts
- Git operations from within workflows
- Working with external APIs
- *Most importantly, it shows how green boxes really don't mean much in terms of skills.*

## How it works
The GitHub Action workflow:
1. Runs on a schedule (daily)
2. Fetches NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day
3. Updates both a log file and this README
4. Commits and pushes the changes

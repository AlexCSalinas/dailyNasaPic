# Daily Auto Commit with NASA Astronomy
This repository demonstrates my ability to automate GitHub workflows using GitHub Actions.

**Stereo Helene**

### Description
Get out your red/blue glasses and float next to Helene, small, icy moon of Saturn. Appropriately named, Helene is a Trojan moon, so called because it orbits at a Lagrange point. A Lagrange point is a gravitationally stable position near two massive bodies, in this case Saturn and larger moon Dione. In fact, irregularly shaped ( about 36 by 32 by 30 kilometers) Helene orbits at Dione's leading Lagrange point while brotherly ice moon Polydeuces follows at Dione's trailing Lagrange point. The sharp stereo anaglyph was constructed from two Cassini images captured during a close flyby in 2011. It shows part of the Saturn-facing hemisphere of Helene mottled with craters and gully-like features.

## What it does
- Runs automatically every day at 12:00 UTC
- Updates a log file with the current date and system information
- Fetches NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day
- **Updates this README with space imagery and descriptions**
- Commits and pushes these changes automatically

## Why I built this
This project showcases:
- GitHub Actions and CI/CD workflows
- Automation scripts
- Git operations from within workflows
- Working with external APIs
- *Most importantly, it shows how green boxes really don't mean much in terms of skills.*

## How it works
The GitHub Action workflow:
1. Runs on a schedule (daily)
2. Fetches NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day
3. Updates both a log file and this README
4. Commits and pushes the changes

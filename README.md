### Description
If you watch long enough, a comet will appear.  Before then, you will see our Solar System from inside the orbit of Mercury as recorded by NASA's Parker Solar Probe looping around the Sun. The video captures coronal streamers into the solar wind, a small Coronal Mass Ejection, and planets including, in order of appearance, Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter. Between the emergence of Earth and Mars, Comet Tempel 1 appears with a distinctive tail.  The continuous fleeting streaks are high energy particles from the Sun impacting Parker's sideways looking camera.  The featured time-lapse video was taken last year during Encounter 21, Parker's 21st close approach to the Sun.  Studying data and images from Parker are delivering a better understanding of the dynamic Sun's effects on Earth's space weather as well as humanity's power grids, spacecraft, and space-faring astronauts.

## What it does
- Runs automatically every day at 12:00 UTC
- Updates a log file with the current date and system information
- Fetches NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day
- **Updates this README with space imagery and descriptions**
- Commits and pushes these changes automatically

## Why I built this
This project showcases:
- GitHub Actions and CI/CD workflows
- Automation scripts
- Git operations from within workflows
- Working with external APIs
- *Most importantly, it shows how green boxes really don't mean much in terms of skills.*

## How it works
The GitHub Action workflow:
1. Runs on a schedule (daily)
2. Fetches NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day
3. Updates both a log file and this README
4. Commits and pushes the changes

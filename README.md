**HH 49: Interstellar Jet from Webb**

### Description
What's at the tip of this interstellar jet?  First let's consider the jet: it is being expelled by a star system just forming and is cataloged as Herbig-Haro 49 (HH 49).  The star system expelling this jet is not visible -- it is off to the lower right.  The complex conical structure featured in this infrared image by the James Webb Space Telescope also includes another jet cataloged as HH 50.  The fast jet particles impact the surrounding interstellar gas and form shock waves that glow prominently in infrared light -- shown here as reddish-brown ridges.  This JWST image also resolved the mystery of the unusual object at HH 49's tip: it is a spiral galaxy far in the distance.  The blue center is therefore not one star but many, and the surrounding circular rings are actually spiral arms.   Jump Around the Universe: Random APOD Generator

## What it does
- Runs automatically every day at 12:00 UTC
- Updates a log file with the current date and system information
- Fetches NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day
- **Updates this README with space imagery and descriptions**
- Commits and pushes these changes automatically

## Why I built this
This project showcases:
- GitHub Actions and CI/CD workflows
- Automation scripts
- Git operations from within workflows
- Working with external APIs
- *Most importantly, it shows how green boxes really don't mean much in terms of skills.*

## How it works
The GitHub Action workflow:
1. Runs on a schedule (daily)
2. Fetches NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day
3. Updates both a log file and this README
4. Commits and pushes the changes
